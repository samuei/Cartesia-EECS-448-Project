Proposal:

  Using a text-based interface, the program will involve the player in the creation of a character. It will then place the character in a world, and allow the user to interact with that world through exploration, combat, and discovery. The user will explore the world, gathering items and equipment that may help to solve puzzles or assist in combat. As the user explores, he or she will become involved in a storyline.

  Combat will also influence the user’s life in the game. As the user defeats enemies, he or she will gain powerful new items and experience. This experience will allow the user’s character to advance in level, and hence in power. Combat will also be affected by the equipment that the user’s character is wearing.

  Throughout the storyline, different achievements will be presented to entertain and encourage the user during slow periods. The user will interact with the program via the terminal. The user’s commands will be interpreted by the program using a parser.
 
  General stories will be created for the different avenues a user may choose. From there, patterns between stories will be identified and made into modular pieces to use throughout the game.
